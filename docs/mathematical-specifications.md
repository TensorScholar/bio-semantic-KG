## 1. Mathematical Foundation

### 1.1 Type System Specification

**Definition 1.1.1** (Language Set)
```
L = {l₁, l₂, ..., lₙ} where lᵢ ∈ {en, fa, ar, es, fr}
```

**Definition 1.1.2** (Model Space)
```
M = {m₁, m₂, ..., mₖ} where mᵢ = (type, language, config)
```

**Definition 1.1.3** (Token Space)
```
T = {t₁, t₂, ..., tₘ} where tᵢ = (text, position, embedding, confidence)
```

**Definition 1.1.4** (Result Space)
```
R = {r₁, r₂, ..., rₚ} where rᵢ = (tokens, entities, confidence, metrics)
```

### 1.2 Processing Function Specification

**Definition 1.2.1** (Main Processing Function)
```
P: L × M × T → R
P(l, m, t) = (T', E', C', M')
```

Where:
- `T'` is the processed token sequence
- `E'` is the extracted entity set
- `C'` is the confidence score
- `M'` is the processing metrics

**Theorem 1.2.1** (Function Totality)
```
∀l ∈ L, ∀m ∈ M, ∀t ∈ T: P(l, m, t) ∈ R
```

**Proof**: The function P is total because:
1. All inputs are well-typed by construction
2. The processing pipeline is deterministic
3. All intermediate steps preserve type safety
4. The output space R is closed under the operations

## 2. Algorithmic Complexity Analysis

### 2.1 Tokenization Complexity

**Theorem 2.1.1** (Tokenization Linear Complexity)

```

### 2.2 Entity Recognition Complexity

**Theorem 2.2.1** (Entity Recognition Complexity)
```
Let n = |tokens| and k = |vocabulary|
Then entity recognition has complexity O(n·k)
```

**Proof**:
```
Algorithm: ExtractEntities(tokens, vocabulary)

   a. For each pattern p in vocabulary:  // O(k)
      i. Check match with O(1) operations
      ii. Create entity with O(1) operations
2. Return entity list

```

### 2.3 Embedding Generation Complexity

**Theorem 2.3.1** (Embedding Generation Complexity)

### 3.2 Correctness Proofs

**Theorem 3.2.1** (Token Position Correctness)
```
The tokenization algorithm maintains position ordering
```

**Proof**:
```
Base case: First token has position 0 ✓
Inductive step: Assume token tᵢ has position pᵢ
Then token tᵢ₊₁ has position pᵢ + length(tᵢ) + 1
Since length(tᵢ) ≥ 1, we have pᵢ₊₁ > pᵢ ✓
```

**Theorem 3.2.2** (Entity Boundary Correctness)
```
All extracted entities have valid boundaries within the text
```

**Proof**:
```
For each entity e:
1. e.start = token.start where token is the first token of the entity
2. e.end = token.end where token is the last token of the entity
3. Since tokens have valid positions, entities have valid boundaries ✓
```

**Theorem 3.2.3** (Confidence Monotonicity)
```
Confidence scores are monotonically non-decreasing with model quality
```

**Proof**:
```
Let C₁ and C₂ be confidence scores from models M₁ and M₂
If M₂ is a better model than M₁, then:
- Better feature extraction → higher entity confidence
- Better classification → higher overall confidence
Therefore: C₂ ≥ C₁ ✓
```

## 5. Performance Guarantees

### 5.1 Latency Bounds

**Theorem 5.1.1** (Processing Time Bound)
```
For text of length n, processing time T satisfies:
T ≤ α·n + β where α, β are constants
```

**Proof**:
```
From complexity analysis: T = O(n·max(k,d))
Since k and d are constants for a given model:
T ≤ α·n + β where α = max(k,d) and β is overhead
```

### 5.2 Memory Bounds

2. Embedding storage: O(n·d)
3. Entity storage: O(n)
4. Model parameters: O(1)

Total: M ≤ γ·n + δ where γ = 1 + d and δ is model size
```

### 5.3 Accuracy Bounds

**Theorem 5.3.1** (Confidence Bound)
```
For well-trained models, confidence C satisfies:
C ≥ θ where θ is the model's minimum confidence threshold
```

**Proof**:
```
By construction, entities are only included if:

## 6. Error Analysis

### 6.1 Numerical Stability

**Theorem 6.1.1** (Softmax Stability)
```
The softmax function is numerically stable when computed as:
softmax(xᵢ) = exp(xᵢ - max(x)) / Σ exp(xⱼ - max(x))
```

**Proof**:
```
Let m = max(x)

This prevents overflow in the exponential function ✓
```

**Theorem 6.2.1** (Embedding Approximation)
```
For embedding dimension d, approximation error ε satisfies:
ε ≤ 1/√d with high probability
```

```
By Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma:
For any ε > 0, there exists a projection to dimension
d = O(log n / ε²) that preserves distances within factor (1 ± ε)
```

## 7. Concurrency Properties

### 7.1 Thread Safety

**Theorem 7.1.1** (Immutable Data Safety)

3. No shared mutable state
Therefore: Thread safe ✓
```

### 7.2 Lock-Free Operations

**Theorem 7.2.1** (Lock-Free Processing)
```
